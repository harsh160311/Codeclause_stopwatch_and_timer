# TIMER AND STOPWATCH
During my second task at CodeClause for my internship, I successfully developed a Stopwatch and Timer page using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Stopwatch feature allows users to precisely measure elapsed time, providing accurate results. Simultaneously, the Timer functionality enables users to set specific countdowns, enhancing time management capabilities. Implementing a clean and user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS, I ensured a seamless experience for anyone utilizing the Stopwatch and Timer features. Leveraging the power of JavaScript, the functionality was brought to life, allowing for precise timekeeping and dynamic interactions on the web page. This task not only honed my skills in front-end development but also provided a practical application of JavaScript for real-world functionality.
